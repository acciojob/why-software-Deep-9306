	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building useful tools that make people's lives easier. Programming lets me turn ideas into working applications, learn continuously, and collaborate with others to create efficient, scalable solutions. The creativity, logical thinking, and real-world impact of development motivate me to grow my skills and contribute meaningfully to projects that matter.</p>
